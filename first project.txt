PROJECT PURPOSE

The main purpose of this project is:

To demonstrate backend web development using Flask

To integrate third-party APIs

To implement user authentication

To connect a web application with a MySQL database

To manage sensitive data securely using environment variables

TECHNOLOGIES USED

>Backend: Python, Flask

>Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

>Database: MySQL

>API: API Ninjas (Quotes API)

>Environment Management: Python Virtual Environment

>Configuration: dotenv (.env file)

PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE EXPLANATION

env / env_AI
These are Python virtual environment folders used to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-wide Python packages.

templates/
This folder contains all HTML files rendered by Flask:

home.html – Landing page of the application

ai_quote.html – Displays AI-generated quotes with author and category

login.html – User login interface

registration.html – User registration interface

.env
Stores sensitive information such as:

API keys

Database credentials

Flask secret key

app.py
The main application file that:

Initializes the Flask app

Connects to the MySQL database

Fetches quotes using an external API

Handles routing for home, login, registration, and logout

Processes form data for user authentication

requirements.txt
Contains a list of Python libraries required to run the project, making installation easy and consistent.

style.css
Handles the visual design and layout of the web pages.

script.js
Adds client-side interactivity and dynamic behavior to the application.

.gitignore
Ensures that unnecessary files such as virtual environments and secret configuration files are not uploaded to GitHub.

KEY FUNCTIONALITIES

User Registration
Allows new users to create an account by providing a username, email, and password.

User Login
Authenticates users by verifying credentials stored in the MySQL database.

AI Quote Generation
Fetches random quotes from an external API and displays them dynamically.

Secure Configuration
Uses environment variables to protect sensitive data.

Template Rendering
Flask renders dynamic HTML pages using Jinja templates.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Sensitive information is stored in .env files

Database credentials are not hard-coded

.gitignore prevents exposure of secret files
